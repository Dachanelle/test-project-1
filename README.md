[https://www.w3schools.com/js, https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+color+picker&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS865US865&oq=hex+color+picker&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i67i433l2j0i67j0i67i433l2j0i67l2j0i67i433j0i67.1958j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8]


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I did not encounter a challenge during this project as I am familiar with Javascript, CSS and HTML.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on the project, I would improve the functionality, the look, sounds and make it a different game. The sounds would be animal noises, and instead of only memorizing the pattern, the user would have to name the animal as well after they have learned the routine successfully. That would be the criteria to win the game. The game could also have multiple rounds wherein the second round, instead of sounds, the color or number of buttons appear in a pattern in a couple of seconds. The user would then have to click the buttons in the proper order. They must all be correct to win.]
